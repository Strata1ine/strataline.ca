<Card.Faq
  title="How long does bathroom renovation take?"
>

Once all materials are delivered, the renovation may take from one week to two weeks, depending on the complexity of the project. I always insist on having all the materials delivered prior to starting the project so that everything is at hand once the work begins.

<Card.Faq
  title="Will my house remain clean during the renovation?"
>

Yes! Throughout the entire project, we will ensure your home remains clean. All dirt, dust, and debris will be contained, and once the work is complete, we will thoroughly clean the bathroom, leaving it ready for use.
