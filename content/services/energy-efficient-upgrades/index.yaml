      - title: Air Sealing
        desc: |-
          Air sealing is one of the most effective and affordable ways to improve your

          around windows, doors, attics, basements, and utility penetrations. This reduces
          heat loss, stabilizes indoor temperatures, improves air quality, and lowers
          your monthly utility bills.

    title: Have Questions About Energy Efficiency?
    content:
    - title: Which upgrades offer the best savings?
      desc: >
        Insulation upgrades, air sealing, and high-efficiency windows deliver the highest
        return on investment by significantly reducing heating and cooling losses.

    - title: Do these upgrades qualify for rebates?
      desc: >
        Many upgrades qualify for federal and provincial rebates. Eligibility depends on
        your home’s energy audit results and which upgrades you choose. We assist with
        the entire rebate process.

    - title: How long does an energy-efficient upgrade take?
      desc: >
        Most upgrades—such as insulation, air sealing, thermostat installation, or lighting—can be
        completed in one day. Larger installations like windows or tankless heaters typically
        take 1–2 days.

    - title: Do I need an energy audit first?
      desc: >
        Yes. A pre-upgrade energy assessment is required for most rebates. We help schedule
        the audit with a certified energy advisor.

    - title: What areas of the Greater Toronto Area do you serve?
      desc: >
        We serve all of the GTA, including Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan,
        Richmond Hill, Markham, Oakville, Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, and Oshawa.

    - title: How much can I expect to save on energy bills?
      desc: >
        Savings vary by home, but typical improvements reduce heating and cooling consumption
        by 15–30%. Some upgrades, like air sealing, have immediate impact.

    - title: Are tankless water heaters more efficient?
      desc: >
        Yes—tankless systems only heat water when needed. This reduces standby energy loss
        and provides unlimited hot water with lower operating costs.

    - title: Can you help me choose the most cost-effective upgrades?
      desc: >
        Absolutely. We assess your home's energy usage and recommend upgrades that offer
        the best combination of comfort, savings, and rebate value.

    - title: Do you handle installation and cleanup?
      desc: >
        Yes. All upgrades include full installation, jobsite protection, cleanup, and
        disposal of old materials where needed.

    - title: How soon can you start after the audit?
      desc: >
        Most projects can begin within a few days of the audit report being released.
