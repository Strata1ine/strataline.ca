          Once all materials are delivered, the renovation typically takes 1–2 weeks depending on the complexity. We always require materials to be onsite before starting to avoid delays.
      - title: Will my house remain clean during the renovation?
        desc: |-
          Yes. All dust and debris are contained, and after completion we thoroughly clean the bathroom so it’s ready to use immediately.
